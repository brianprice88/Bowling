# Bowling

This is a bowling game built as a a one-day 'mini app' challenge.  The scoring system hasn't yet been perfected to cover all rules regarding strikes and spares (I didn't know bowling was so complicated!), but otherwise allows the player to click on a rotating random number to determine their score for a given roll.

NPM install (to install dependencies)

NPM run build (to start webpack)

NPM start (to run the server and database, which will track high scores)
